`smpsave <https://github.com/tbeeck/smpsave>`_: save money running private game servers

Welcome to the documentation of `smpsave`.

`smpsave` is a command line tool and Discord bot that provides a convenient way
to set up and tear down a private game server on demand, in order to minimize
cloud hosting costs for gamers who don't need 24/7 uptime.

Here you will find all of the information you need to get started using and extending the module.
